# def-fn

NOTE: Suppors only Clojurescript currently

Def-fn is a macro that acts like a defn but requires map as its first argument.

``` clojure
(def-fn func [{:keys [first second third] :or {third 3}} ...]
  [first second third])
```

Argument use is checked at compile time instead of runtime. func requires `first` and `second` to be defined at call-site but since `third` is defined as optional it is not required.

``` clojure
(func {:first 1
       :second 2})
```
